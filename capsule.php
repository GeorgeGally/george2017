	A quirky archive/disposable time capsule of life in Cape Town at the turn of the century.
	<br><br>
	Macs no longer came with a 1.44Mb disk drive, spelling the end of analogue/digital disk based technology.
	Disks had virtually become disposable and this seemed like a perfect media hack waiting to happen. And so Capsule was born.
	<br><br>Distributed free on floppy disk each issue was also playfully packaged according to the theme.
	<br><br>
	Other than it being an unusual take on our environment on a strange medium,
	it was a major feat to squeeze an extremely large amount of information and interactivity on 1.44MB<br><br>
	The magazine instantly became a cult hit, and launched
	my new agency, Radarboy, as a major player in South Africa. By awards - radarboy was only the second digital agency in South Africa, and the smallest agency ever, to feature
	in the country's top 10 agencies. The first being my previous agency Tinderbox - where I earned a host of awards including 3 Loerie's (one of which was the first-ever Grand Prix for a digital work for <a href="thinking.php">Thinking Multimedia</a>), a SPADA gold and a One Show special mention
	for my work.</p>

<p>
		Capsule was awarded two Gold Loeries, an Invision Gold (to put in persepective Real Player was also a Gold winner), a Construction Award and a SPADA Gold. <br><br>
	Concept, design, animation, programming <br>
	Technologies: Flash<br><br>
