<h5>Hi. I'm George Gally, designer, creative director, coder, tinkerer and dreamer.</h5>
<br>
I am a senior creative, with over 15 years experience, especially interested in pushing innovation, physical real world interactions, and the quirky and unusual. I have built an award winning career in advertising and design working in both above the line and digital agencies in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Hong Kong, Berlin and Tokyo.
<br><br>
I am South Africa's most awarded digital creative and one of only two people ever to win a Loerie Grand Prix (South Africa's most important advertising awards) in the digital category.
<br><br>


</div>

<div class="add-top  add-bottom  one-third column">
 Most recently I held the positions of Creative Director at TBWA/HK, Director of Innovation at Quirk Agency, Johannesburg, participated in a Google startup incubator programme in Cape Town, exhibited as an artist in Berlin and Milan and worked as Associate CD at Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Tokyo. <br><br>
 I enjoy experimenting with emerging or dying technologies, and am comfortable working in pretty much any medium, but mostly excited by technology and how this crosses over with real world analogue interactions.<br><br>
</div>

<div class="add-top  add-bottom  one-third column">
Although I see myself mainly as a visual artist, I am also a self-taught creative coder, able to programme in most computer languages. When not designing, I spend my time making music, thinking and tinkering about with technology, and working in experiential art.  <br><br>
I have a Cum Laude degree in Social Science from the University of Cape Town and a Diploma in Journalism from Cape Technikon.


<!--
I have an blog (<a href="http://www.radarboy.com">http://www.radarboy.com</a>) where I post mainly about light art, and other stuff that interests me, and occasionally a personal project.<br><br>
  And I like to play with Twitter, with <a href="www.radarboy_japan">radarboy_japan</a> having a more of an art, human interest and casual theme and a new experiment <a href="www.twitter.com/radarboy3000">radarboy3000</a> - a more honed down stream of what me and my brand stand for.

<br>


I'm a designer, first and foremost. Highly skilled in the Adobe Suite of products. I love vector graphics and loved the aesthetics of Flash - where I spent most of my early career experimenting.
As a Creative Director, you also get to (unfortunately) spend a lot of time in Powerpoint, but these days I try, and encourage my team, to build presentations only in HTML.<br>
<br>
In coding, I'm most excited about Javascript and putting most of my learning time into this. But would say I have most experience in PHP, Processing and Actionscript. <br>

<br>
Coding Languages: <br>
PHP, Javascript, Java/Processing, Actionscript, Ruby.

<br><br>
Libraries and Frameworks: <br>
CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, d3.js and most recently been dabbling in Meteor, OpenFrameworks and Cinder.

<br><br>
Technologies: <br>
Data visualization, face tracking, motion reactive, sound reactive, kinect, light installations, arduino,
LED, physical computing, sensors.
