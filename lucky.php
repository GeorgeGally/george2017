		What started out as a simple production job for a microsite, led to a more than two your collaboration and brand curatorship with Lucky Strike.  The client eventually trusted us so much that briefs turned into open briefs and the collaboration extended into the physical space with events, kiosks, projections, game cabinets and treasure hunt webcams.

		<br><br>
		I lead the concept and design team. This was social media, before social media.
		 The project was so succesful that it was work was exported to Japan as well as being presented at the  global Lucky Strike brand managers conference as a template for the brand's tone of voice and style. <br><br>

				<b>Lucky Strike Conclusion Post Event Site </b><br><br>

				This was the last of the series of free secret events Lucky Strike was going to do, featuring the Beastie Boys. Others had featured Paul Okenfold, Violent Femmes, Live, to name a few. I did a number of post-event sites for Lucky Strike, but I think this was my favourite.
				<br><br>The post event site included such things as a social drum machine, interactive magazine elements such as an irreverent look into the history of the mixtape, as well as chat, video and photo downloads.
				<br><br>
				We were also involved in the events themselves, helping conceptualize activities and building touch screen kiosks, live SMS broadcast engines, digital graffiti machines, games and branded ticket/fingerprint scanning interfaces.<br><br>

	<b>Lucky Strike Believe Registration Site</b> <br><br>
A pre-regsitration and playful brand site, that was a particular challenge because we had to work out an entertaining and aesthetically pleasing way to deal with severe bandwidth limitations and thousands of simultaneous registrations.<br><br>

The site resulted in a large amount of buzz being created around the brand and the events (receiving 6000+ registrations in 10 minutes) and an extremely happy client, and which directly led to our long  collaboration with Lucky Strike, encompassing magazines, events and installations, until new tobacco legislation prevented any further marketing of this kind.

<b>Lucky Access Key Emailer </b><br><br>
Access to a closed website was restricted to those who received the key after attending an event. The key was sent out the day after the event, the concept being a combination of key/discovery and a post-event chillout piece.

		<b>Lucky Strike World Emailer </b><br><br>
		I've always believed in creating content as an effective way of brand building. A brand feel-piece mailer for Lucky Strike, communicating the character and history of the brand in a fun and irreverent way, sent as an initial introduction to all who signed up to receive correspondence from the company.
		<br><br>
		Was presented globally by Lucky Strike as an example of great brand communications. Technically difficult to get some much content into a few hundred kilobytes, as at that time most people in South Africa were still on dail-up connections.
		<br><br>
		Role on project: concept, art direction, lead design and flash animation.

		One of the world's first mobile flash applications.
		Was particularly challenging as Flash for mobile was still in beta. It was also groundbreaking in our method of loading and flushing frames to simulate video.

			Lucky Strike required an interactive Brand Manual to be loaded on iPaq's for their sales consultants. It was necessary for them to be able to access System Procedure as well as having an introduction to the brand. The application introduced the brand and all it's associated elements, from sounds and smells to colour and form, as well as having the administrative procedures 2 clicks away.
